"""Mock function support based on GObject Introspection.

(Note to reviewers: I expect to rewrite this from scratch on my own time as
a more generalised set of Python modules for unit testing of C code,
although using similar core ideas.  This is a first draft for the purpose of
getting Click's test suite to work expediently, rather than an interface I'm
prepared to commit to long-term.)

Python is a versatile and concise language for writing tests, and GObject
Introspection (GI) makes it straightforward (often trivial) to bind native
code into Python.  However, writing tests for native code quickly runs into
the problem of how to build mock functions.  You might reasonably have code
that calls chown(), for instance, and want to test how it's called rather
than worrying about setting up a fakeroot-type environment where chown()
will work.  The obvious solution is to use `LD_PRELOAD` wrappers, but there
are various problems to overcome in practice:

 * You can only set up a new `LD_PRELOAD` by going through the run-time
   linker; you can't just set it for a single in-process test case.
 * Generating the preloaded wrapper involves a fair bit of boilerplate code.
 * Having to write per-test mock code in C is inconvenient, and makes it
   difficult to get information back out of the mock (such as "how often was
   this function called, and with what arguments?").

The first problem can be solved by a decorator that knows how to run
individual tests in a subprocess.  This is made somewhat more inconvenient
by the fact that there is no way for a context manager's `__enter__` method
to avoid executing the context-managed block other than by throwing an
exception, which makes it hard to silently avoid executing the test case in
the parent process, but we can work around this at the cost of an extra line
of code per invocation.

For the rest, a combination of GI itself and ctypes can help.  We can use GI
to keep track of argument and return types of the mocked C functions in a
reasonably sane way, by parsing header files.  We're operating in the other
direction from how GI is normally used, so PyGObject can't deal with
bridging the two calling conventions for us.  ctypes can: but we still need
to be careful!  We have to construct the callback functions in the child
process, ensure that we keep references to them, and inject function
pointers into the preloaded library via specially-named helper functions;
until those function pointers are set up we must make sure to call the libc
functions instead (since some of them might be called during Python
startup).

The combination of all of this allows us to bridge C functions somewhat
transparently into Python.  This lets you supply a Python function or method
as the mock replacement for a C library function, making it much simpler to
record state.

It's still not perfect:

 * We're using GI in an upside-down kind of way, and we specifically need
   GIR files rather than typelibs so that we can extract the original C
   type, so some fiddling is required for each new function you want to
   mock.

 * The subprocess arrangements are unavoidably slow and it's possible that
   they may cause problems with some test runners.

 * Some C functions (such as `stat`) tend to have multiple underlying entry
   points in the C library which must be preloaded independently.

 * You have to be careful about how your libraries are linked, because `ld
   -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions` prevents `LD_PRELOAD` working for intra-library
   calls.

 * `ctypes should return composite types from callbacks
   <http://bugs.python.org/issue5710>`_.  The least awful approach for now
   seems to be to construct the composite type in question, stash a
   reference to it forever, and then return a pointer to it as a void *; we
   can only get away with this because tests are by nature relatively
   short-lived.

 * The ctypes module's handling of 64-bit pointers is basically just awful.
   The right answer is probably to use a different callback-generation
   framework entirely (maybe extending PyGObject so that we can get at the
   pieces we need), but I've hacked around it for now.

 * It doesn't appear to be possible to install mock replacements for
   functions that are called directly from Python code using their GI
   wrappers.  You can work around this by simply patching the GI wrapper
   instead, using `mock.patch`.

I think the benefits, in terms of local clarity of tests, are worth the
downsides.
